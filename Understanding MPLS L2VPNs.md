# MPLS L2VPNs

L2VPNs offer a means to tunnel layer 2 traffic over MPLS network. The L2VPNs can be point to point or point to multipoint. Letâ€™s take a look on what options are available to us

# Point to point L2VPNs
The point to point L2VPNS are technically referred to as Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and they are of three types
-	Martini L2VPN
-	VPWS Kompella using BGP auto-discovery and signalling
-	VPWS BGP Auto discovery and LDP signalling FEC129;

### 1. Martini L2VPNs
This type of VPWS uses LDP as its signalling protocol. They are mostly referred to as layer 2 circuit or cross-connect. This implementation does not offer auto discovery features and both ends of the connections have to be configured manually to establish targeted LDP sessions. There is another implementation of this that uses IP instead of MPLS to tunnel layer 2 traffic called L2TPv3 in Cisco.

### 2. VPWS Kompella using BGP auto-discovery and signalling
This type of VPWS uses BGP instead of LDP, the neighbours participating in a layer 2 connection can be discovered automatically and sessions will be established using BGP as a signalling protocol. BGP is used as both neighbor discovery protocol and signalling protocol.
To accommodate these features a new BGP NLRI was introduced to the NLRI is l2vpn. This design uses the concept of site-ids to establish sessions, the site ids are supposed to be on contagious blocks also uses extended BGP communities to carry neighbour and layer 2 route information such as route-target, route-distinguisher, site-id and remote-site-id.
> Note: Cisco does not support this implementation

### 3. VPWS BGP Auto discovery and LDP signalling FEC129;
Very much like the previous design, this type of VPWS uses BGP for neighbour discovery only then LDP is used for signalling. This implementation uses BGP NLRI l2vpn for auto-discovery-only as well as extended BGP communities; route targets and l2vpn-id.
The presence of the l2vpn-id designates that FEC 129 LDP signaling is used for the routing instance. The absence of l2vpn-id indicates that BGP signaling is used instead

# Point to multipoint L2VPNs
The point to point L2VPNS are technically referred to as Virtual Private Line Service (VPLS) in this type of configuration the provider networks acts as a switch and the PEs involved will be learning mac-address information.

### 1. VPLS Manual discovery and LDP signalling FEC128 
This implementation requires neighbouring routers participating in the VPLS instance to be explicitly configured on each of the participating routers and it uses LDP as the signalling protocol.

### 2. VPLS BGP Auto discovery and LDP signalling FEC129
This is an enhancement to the above implementation that offers auto discovery of neighbors participating in a VPLS instance. Uses the BGP NLRI l2vpn for auto-discovery-only as well as extended BGP communities; route targets and l2vpn-id.
FEC 129 uses BGP autodiscovery to convey endpoint information, so you do not need to manually configure pseudowires. BGP is responsible for distributing the local autodiscovery routes created on each PE device to all other PE devices. LDP is responsible for using the autodiscovery information provided by BGP to set up targeted LDP sessions over which to signal the pseudowires.

### 3. VPLS BGP Auto discovery and BGP signalling
This implementation uses BGP for both neighbors discovery and signalling.

### 4. VPLS Mixed LDP and BGP
This is a hybrid implementation where both VPWS and VPLS are combined to offer the best of both worlds.

# Configuration samples
## Martini L2VPN
Below configuration between Cisco IOS XE and JunOS with existing IP and MPLS underlying configuration

### Cisco config and verification
<pre>
interface Gi0/0/0.1001
Encapsulation dot1q 1001
xconnect 10.2.2.2 1001 encapsulation mpls

show xconnect interface Gi0/0/0.1001
show mpls l2transport vc 1001
show l2vpn atom vc vcid 1001

### JunOS config and verification
<pre>

set interface ge-0/0/0.1001 encapsulation vlan-ccc

show l2circuit connection interface ge-0/0/0.1001
</pre>

## Local layer 2 circuit
For L2 circuit whose ends terminate on the same router, that is, two different logical interfaces(or physical) for both ends are configured on the same router there is a number of options to go about it as listed below:
- Interface-switch
- Bridge-domain
- local-switching

### Interface-switch
This JunOS feature allows for configuration of Layer 2 switching cross-connects. The cross-connect is  bidirectional, so packets received on the first interface are transmitted out the second interface, and those received on the second interface are  transmitted out the first.  For Layer 2 switching cross-connects to work, you must also configure MPLS.
The interface-switch can only be configured between two interfaces not more as it does not involve learning of mac addresses and it simply mirrors traffic between the two interfaces if you will.
